Professional Java Developer Career Starter: Java Foundations Course Exercise Solutions

The solutions are generally to be found in src/main/test folder. Solutions for each section/module will be in packages ending with the name of the section.
So, solutions for section 1 or in the package, com.neutrinosys.java.foundations.solutions.section2_classes_objects.
The solutions are implemented as JUnit tests, though there are not assertions (you'll learn what that means in a later module).
Some solutions refer to classes created elsewhere. In those cases, the classes will be in src/main/java/, but you can control/command click on the referenced
classes to jump into their code.
